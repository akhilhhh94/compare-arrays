# compare-arrays

Compare arrays in javascript is not an job because `===` will not work as expected. 
So this package is perfect solution for this. 

## How it works

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install compare-arrays --save`

```javascript
import compare from 'compare-arrays';
compare([],[]) // return true or false
```
Thank you
